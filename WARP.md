# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized Git repository connected to https://github.com/FBAiPro/FBAiPro.git. The codebase has not yet been established.

## Initial Setup Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Pull any existing code from remote
git pull origin main

# If this is a fresh start, you may want to:
# - Add a README.md
# - Set up package.json (for Node.js projects)  
# - Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml (for Python projects)
# - Create initial project structure
```

## Development Guidelines

Once the codebase is established, this file should be updated to include:

1. **Build Commands**: How to build the project
2. **Testing Commands**: How to run tests (full suite and individual tests)  
3. **Linting/Formatting**: Code quality tools and their usage
4. **Architecture Overview**: High-level code organization and key patterns
5. **Development Workflow**: Branch naming, commit conventions, etc.

## Next Steps

When you start developing in this repository:

1. Update this WARP.md file with project-specific commands and architecture
2. Consider what technology stack you'll be using (Python, Node.js, etc.)
3. Set up appropriate tooling (package managers, linters, test frameworks)
4. Document the core architectural decisions and patterns

## Notes

- Repository name suggests this might be an AI-related professional tool
- Consider adding appropriate `.gitignore` for your chosen technology stack
- Update this file as the project structure becomes clear
